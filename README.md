# EasyKinetics

Easy Kinetics is a software created with the aim of simplifying the study of enzymatic kinetics conducted in biochemical laboratories all over the world. This software can perform a complete kinetic analysis for any enzyme, needing less spectrophotometric measures compared to traditional commercial softwares; showing in this way the following advantages:  

- save the time of the researcher

- save materials and money needed to perform the experiment

- facilitate the work of both experienced and novice students / researchers

- minimize experimental errors expected from multiple measures  

Furthermore Easy Kinetics has been implemented to perform:

- enzymatic inhibition studies

- Bradford assays

- enzymatic units assays

- calculate absorbance variation per minute of a sample.

Finally the software is optimized to self-detect possible substrate-inhibition kinetics and to self-correct any typing errors (eg. * or a) in the various input fields.
